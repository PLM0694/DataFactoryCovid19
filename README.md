# DataFactoryCovid19

Hands on practice, following course: https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-azure-data-factory-from-scratch/ 

Instead of using the outdated data from the course, I decided to pull the new data directly from the ECDC Covid-19 site on Mar 22, 2023: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data

Azure Data Factory pipeline to load data into our Data Lake.
